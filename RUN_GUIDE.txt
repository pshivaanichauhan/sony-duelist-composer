# Run Guide for sony-duelist-composer ðŸŽ¼

This guide explains how to run and test the Humanâ€“AI duet generator.

---

## 1. Requirements
- Python 3.9 or higher  
- No additional libraries needed for basic run.  

Optional (for testing and extensions):  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 2. Running the Duel
To run a default 8-bar duel:
```bash
python duel.py
```

This will print Human + AI moves bar by bar with scores.

---

## 3. Viewing Example Output
Open the included file:  
```
examples/duel_output.txt
```  
This shows a sample duel with scoring.

---

## 4. Running Tests
To check scoring logic is correct:
```bash
pytest test_scoring.py
```

---

## 5. Using CLI
Run with custom options:
```bash
python cli.py --bars 8 --save examples/output.txt
```

Options:
- `--bars N` â†’ number of bars in the duel  
- `--save PATH` â†’ save output to file  

---

## 6. Future Features
- Export duel to MIDI (listen to actual music)  
- Smarter AI that learns to respond  
- Multi-agent quartets (more than duet)

Enjoy exploring humanâ€“AI counterpoint! ðŸŽ¶
